- 👋 Hi, I’m @AnyaTheShepherd though you can call me Anya or Shep.
- 👀 I’m interested in leaving my mark on the world through exploring my passions using programming as a medium with which to arm myself with the tools and knowledge to make a difference in people's lives, one program at a time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about this whole programming, development, deeper inner workings of this wonderful thing we call the internet. I love to peak behind the curtain and see how everything talks to everything, I love learning how processes build upon processes until finally you have the complete product. [I was the kid who read the labels and could pronounce the ingredients]
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever peaks my interest, though far be it from me to turn down opportunities to learn, so if you have a project and you'd like to pass down your knowledge or take the time to help me learn how to do all of this, don't be afraid to ask my availability for apprenticeship work
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me primarily through email at echaney1998@gmail.com or by Discord @anyafenryka [Haha Warhammer 40K reference]
